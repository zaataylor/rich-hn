# TODOs
- Data Model
    - [] Figure out how to get text content of items that are:
        - [&check;] Comments
        - [] Polls
        - [] Ask HNs
        - [] Show HNs
        - [] Jobs
    - [&check;] Figure out how to extract comment trees under a given post
    - [&check;] Figure out where and how to store comment trees
        - [&check;] Store comment trees as a field "kids" with the `Item` those kids are children of
        - [&check;] `Page`s will also store a reference to the comment tree on their own
    - [] Figure out where to take advantage of caching
    - [] Figure out proper way to implement `ItemDB` as a Singleton
        - [] Read about the use of the [Singleton Pattern](https://python-patterns.guide/gang-of-four/singleton/) in Python
        - [] Implement `ItemDB` as a Singleton
        - [] Decide on how to call the `ItemDB` singleton instance. Should it be in `page.py` or `pages.py`?
    - [] Figure out a good way to update comment trees
- Display
    - [] Figure out how to use `rich`'s Markdown support for making blockquotes/code blocks
    - [] Figure out how to use `rich`'s Markdown support for making pager/`more` style scrolling UI. Alternatively, figure out how else to do it without using `rich`.
    - [] Figure out how to display posts in a table or list style
    - [] Figure out how to go about displaying empty pages. For instance, if the number of comments on a given page only spans two pages, and a user tries to navigate to the nonexistent third page, what should happens?
- UX
    - [] Figure out how to support Vim standard keybindings (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`) for scrolling up and down, and navigating forward and backward through pages using.
    - [] Figure out how to use up and down arrow keys for scrolling up and down, and navigating to forward and backward through pages using the left and right arrow keys.
    - [] Figure out how to make the keybindings for scrolling and navigating customizable
    - [] Figure out how to display different colors for `Ask HN`, `Show HN`, `stories`, and `jobs` posts.
    - [] Figure out how to do manual updating of a page's contents using a specific keybinding.
    - [] Figure out a reasonable experience for when a user tries to navigate to a page that doesn't exist, such as navigating to the third page of comments for a post that only has two pages of comments.
